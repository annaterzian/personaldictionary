# personaldictionary

This is my personal project. I want to make a personal dictionary application. The app will allow you to enter words into a database and then automatically define them. It should be able to provide multiple definitions. It should also give the part of speech. There should be a functionality for linking the words to their synonyms and an advancement of such would be indicating the synonyms most similar.

## Core Features

- Add word
- Fetch definition(s)
- Identify part of speech

## Future Features

- Retrieve and possibly link synonyms

## Dependencies

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

## Data Source

- https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary
